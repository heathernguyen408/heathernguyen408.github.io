# This is my Journey in Coding

This is my home page! My name is Heather Nguyen and I am a student at [Cal State Fullerton](http://www.fullerton.edu/) and my major is computer science. This is my portfolio of my journey through coding as a first time coder. I will slowly add onto this portofolio as my journey of coding continues to grow.

### CPSC 120

* Lab 2

    Lab 2; part 1 was a favorite of mine because it was interesting as it was my first few times coding to change Fahrenheit to celsius by a code and not using the standard method of mathematics, but using other aspects to convert Fahrenheit to celsius was terrific. I was able to practice initializing variables when it is declared, practicing to assign integer variables as zero, and also using NAN for doubles and floats when there isnâ€™t a number. I now could write code that involves using the methods I have learned from this lab and convert Fahrenheit to celsius.

    Lab 5

    Lab 5; part 1 was also another favorite because it was interesting how we coded the sandwich order and how a sandwich can relate to coding. What I took from this lab is that I am now capable of declaring and initializing arguments in a std::vector and I can also declare and initialize elements are std::strings that are a part of a shell command. The skills I have taken from this lab are data cleaning and the use of argument vectors from just practicing the order of a sandwich!

    Lab 6
    
    Lab 6; part 2 stood out to me the most due to the fun guessing game involved with the secret number. I was able to master and understand the use of loops and have practiced with boolean. I now could write a small game like guessing the number between one through one hundred, using a loop in the main function, and having the player continue until they win to exit the game.

    This is what I have collected so far.
